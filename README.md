# Collectables

My first try at a Unity3D Game.

# Notices

**All builds are Windows x86 releases.**

Starting from [v0.2.6b](https://github.com/Prouser123/Unity-Collectables/releases/0.2.6b), beta versions of Collectables will only have a portable version.

Stable releases will have:

`- A Portable .zip`

`- An Installer .exe`

# Running the portable .zip

**Notice: Only download Collectables from the official GitHub repo.**

1. Download the .zip for the version you want to run [from here](https://github.com/Prouser123/Unity-Collectables/releases/tag/v0.2.6b).
2. Extract the .zip file, making sure that the Data folder is in the same directory as the .exe
3. Run the .exe
